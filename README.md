I'm Spencer, a software engineer currently working as a mobile dev @ [fnbo](https://www.fnbo.com)

I'm passionate about iOS and Swift, React Native, and delighting customers (because I am one!).

I'm also an extra musician @ [omaha symphony](https://omahasymphony.org) and adjunct professor @ [unomaha](https://www.unomaha.edu)

Most of my commits are on [gitlab](https://www.gitlab.com), deal with it.
