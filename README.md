Hi, I'm Spencer, a software engineer currently employed as an iOS developer. I like building things people enjoy.<br />
I'm most comfortable with native iOS codebases, React and React Native, and I'm learning GraphQL and AWS.<br />
I'm also a professional drummer, music professor, soccer fanatic, runner, and cyclist.
